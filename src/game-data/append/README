An "append" file can be used to manually add data when parsing the latest game master file.  This is useful if a fully up-to-date master has not yet been provided.

For example, to add the fast move Rollout for Blastoise, create append/pokemon.json, and put:

{
	"V0009_POKEMON_BLASTOISE_NORMAL": {
		"fastMoves": [
			"ROLLOUT_FAST"
		]
	}
}

Use the Pokemon's templateId as a key, containing the data that should be appended.

For Pokemon appends, use the scraper tool to retrieve new move additions from the GBL season update page.

For appended moves, we're only concerned with their energyDelta values, which can usually be sourced from reddit after a season switchover.
