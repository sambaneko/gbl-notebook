An "append" file can be used to manually add data when parsing the latest game master file.  This is useful if a fully up-to-date master has not yet been provided.

For example, to add the fast move Rollout for Blastoise, create append/pokemon.json, and put:

{
	"V0009_POKEMON_BLASTOISE_NORMAL": {
		"fastMoves": [
			"ROLLOUT_FAST"
		]
	}
}

Use the Pokemon's templateId as a key, containing the data that should be appended.
